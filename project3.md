## DATA 310 

### Project 3: Applying Geospatial Covariates to Predicting Populations

**Country:**

Malta

**Data:**

The data I used for this project was obtained from a few different sources of raster and population statistics. 
Namely, I downloaded land cover statistics from the Worldpop website of my country, Malta, as well as the administrative 
boundaries from GADM, a geospatial repository with hundreds of datasets. I originally pivoted
away from reusing Colombia from my last project, as it is a much larger and more populous country, and I was
skeptical of my computer's processing ability for the large Colombian datasets. Thus, Malta's smaller boundaries 
were optimal for this project. After downloading this data, I produced these basic plots of the administrative
boundaries:

as well as the region named 'Xlokk' or 'Malta Xlokk':

*Malta Xlokk is known today as the South Eastern Region*
