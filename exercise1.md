# DATA310 - Antonio Marra

 * **Informal Response 1**
  1. Maroney argues that traditional programming identifies the rules and data,
    and then answers are produced using these two inputs. Machine Learning
    uses answers and data as its inputs, and infers the rules from these
    pieces.
  2. An input of 7 yields ~3, depending on the MSE that the optimizer ends
     up with. Answers may vary as the machine's guess accuracy is not always
     predictable.
  3. **Best Deal -** 160 Holly Pt. Road  
     **Worst Deal -** 984 Fitchett's Wharf Road  
     Based on the price per square foot, I have chosen these two houses as the 
     best and worst of our group of houses.
