### Project 1

**Housing Data Scraped from Zillow**


The first and arguably the most important step for this exercise is to initially create 
a database by running code to scrape n=400 houses directly from Zillow's website. I initially
completed this step in class using the first iteration of the zillow_scrape.py code, and this is the 
database which I used in this project. After successfully scraping the data following our instruction
in class, I attempted to create another database from housing data in Miami, FL. However, by this time
the ingenious data scientists at Zillow had made an alteration to their website code that rendered 
my zillow_scrape.py functionally useless.  

Given this alteration, I reverted back to my original dataset [insert dataset link]
