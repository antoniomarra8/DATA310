### ASL Image Segmentation to Fill Teaching Gaps in Deaf Education

**Abstract & Research Question:**

Literature in and around the education discipline in recent years has identified tangible discrepancies
in the availability of teachers qualified to educate deaf and disabled students. According to a 
2019 letter by the Council on Education of the Deaf (CED), there is a crisis in deaf education; a steady decline
in deaf education teacher training programs has left the population of teachers in dire straits. Graduates in
2020 numbered just 11% of the 1982 graduating class, and combined with a high retirement rate, there is
a serious need for educational assistance to avoid burnout and overworking of the existing population
of certified deaf teachers. As language is imperative for the healthy growth of any child, deaf or otherwise, 
lower quality education due to the overworking of teachers is unacceptable. 
Incorporating a machine learning model to conduct examinations and other assignments
can provide breathing room for teachers to better focus their energy on students who may require more assistance,
and simultaneously avoid burnout or early retirement as a result of chronic work-related stress.
Thus, my research question is this: can a ML model use image classification to adequately perform testing 
for elementary and middle school deaf students?


This research is informed by existing studies in deaf education in America specifically, as well as the effects
of AI instructors on learning in students.
